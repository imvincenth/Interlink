<strong>RingIn</strong> is a full stack LinkedIn clone themed around J. R. R. Tolkien's <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> series. Users are able to create their own accounts, to which they are able to add their work <em>experience</em>, <em>education</em>, a <em>profile picture</em> and a <em>banner photo</em>. Like LinkedIn, users can make <em>posts</em>, <em>comments</em>, and create <em>reactions</em> to their own or the posts/comments of other users. Users can use the <em>search feature</em> to find other users, see their profile, experiences, and education, as well as send them a <em>connection request</em>. Users are able to utilize the <em>network manager</em> component to see their sent and received connection requests, from which they are also able to accept or ignore incoming requests or withdraw their pending sent connections.
